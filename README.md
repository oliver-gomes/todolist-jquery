## How I built the Color Game

- Designed the app first in Adobe XD before coding.
- Setup HTML with div, ul, li for list items and added classes and id to take the element for manipulation
- CSS for design the whole app
- Used jQuery to make interactive decisions
- Started with toggleClass method to change 'completed' class which when click, crossed of the list item
- Moved on to remove the list when trash icon clicked. Also, added fadeOut method for clean effect
- Used keypress event to listen for the enter key and add the input to a new list
- Lastly added an event to the plus sign which fade out the input field.

#### I made a Youtube video of the whole process from start to finish
